RavenDBMembershipUser needs to override any other member of MembershipUser to call into RavenDBMembershipProvider.
For now, it only overrides MembershipUser.ChangePassword.

MembershipProviderValidated should wrap each override in RavenDBMembership, to include validation equivalent to SqlMembershipProvider's validation.

There's lots of room for optimizing by reducing the number of sessions created, once things are functionally complete.
