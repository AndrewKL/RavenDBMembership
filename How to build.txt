In order to build this project, you need to execute the psake build script from the PowerShell console.  
You do this using the following command from the root project directory:

    .\psake.ps1 .\default.ps1 -properties @{
        tempPath="c:\temp\RavenDBMembershipTemp";
        sqlConnectionString="Database='`$_';Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=True"
    }
   

You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as adminstrator:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
    

The script requires a connection string, with a token for the database name.  
The permissions of the connection need to allow the dbcreator permission.  A 
database named 'RavenDBMembershipTestSqlDatabase' will be created, destroyed 
and recreated as tests run.

The script requires you pick a temporary path.  The tests will create and 
destroy database files in that path.  That path should not be cleaned up 
between test runs, otherwise SQL gets confused.  I haven't figured out how 
to fix it, if you delete the temp path you'll need to delete the test 
database from SQL server manually.
